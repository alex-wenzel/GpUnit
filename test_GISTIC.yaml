# assertions is the most finicky section
# by default each test will fail if the job status is ERROR
# additionally you can define the following
assertions: 
    # fail unless there are 7 result files
    numFiles: 7
    # fail unless one of the result files is named, 'all_lesions_file.gp_gistic.txt',
    # At the moment, you must include the '!!null', however I am working on improving this
    files: 
        "all_lesions_file.gp_gistic.txt": !!null
