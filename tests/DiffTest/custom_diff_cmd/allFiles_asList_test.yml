#
# example test-case, showing how to use a custom 'diff' command
# to compare the actual result files with the expected result files
#
#
module: ConvertLineEndings
params: 
    # note, the !!java.io.File casts the input.filename param from a String to a File type
    #    a File means, 'upload the file from my client machine to the server as part of the SOAP call to submit the job'
    #    by default, for file input parameters, a String, means 'this is a server file path', passed literally to the server
    input.filename: !!java.io.File ../Input.txt
assertions:
    # declare custom diff cmd, to apply to an individual result file
    # in this case, use a List<String> arg for the diffCmd
    diffCmd: [org.genepattern.gpunit.diff.CmdLineDiff, diff, -q]
    files:
        Input.cvt.txt:
            diff: ../Input.cvt.txt
