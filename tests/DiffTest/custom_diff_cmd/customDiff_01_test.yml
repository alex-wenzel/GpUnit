# example test-case, showing how to use a custom 'diff' command
# to compare the actual result files with the expected result files

module: ConvertLineEndings
params: 
    input.filename: !!java.io.File ../Input.txt
assertions:
    # declare custom diff cmd, to apply to all result files listed in
    # the assertions.files section
    #
    # your command must return a 0 exitCode if there are no diffs and a non-zero exit code if there are diffs
    #     That is how you tell gp-unit that your custom diff command detected a *significant* difference.
    #     A significant different means, the test-case should fail.
