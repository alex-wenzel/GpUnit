    # declare custom diff cmd, to apply to all result files listed in

    # in this case, use a single String value for the diffCmd
    # the myDiff.sh is the shell script to execute. The './' prefix is required. It means,
    #    When validating the job results using this custom diff command, look for my executable shell file
    #    in the same directory as this test-case file.
